# MacroTracker
MacroTracker is an iOS application written in React.js using Expo and back4app as its backend. This application
allows users to track their daily nutrition in terms of caloric intake, protein intake, carbohydrate intake,
and fat intake.  Users are able to enter the items that commprise their meals and snacks throughout the day.
MacroTracker continously tracks daily macro totals and displays macro-meal breakdowns and progress to the
user's daily intake goals.  A running history of daily nutrition is stored for later retrieval and reference
upon the user's request.
